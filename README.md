# Tutorial on Topological Data Analysis
Written by Shizuo KAJI

This Jupyter-note book is prepared for the online event:
[TDA for Applications: Tutorial and Workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/tda-application-tutorial/)
being held on 18,19 June 2020.

## Main Examples
Our [main example](TopologicalDataAnalysisWithPython.ipynb) runs on Google Colaboratory so that you do not have to set up a Python environment on your computer.

[Open in Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/github/shizuo-kaji/TutorialTopologicalDataAnalysis/blob/master/TopologicalDataAnalysisWithPython.ipynb).

This includes
- Feature extraction using persistent homology from various types of data (point cloud, graph, image, volume, time-series)
- Regression/Classification using topological features
- Dimension reduction preserving topological features
- Visualisation revealing the shape of data

## Deep Learning X TDA
How Deep Learning and Persistent homology can be combined is demonstrated [here](https://github.com/shizuo-kaji/HomologyCNN).

## NLP Example (vectorise and visualise)
As an example of Natural Language Processing, we look at maths papers on arXiv.
This example runs only locally and not on Google Colab.

[Here is an instruction](NLP_example.md)

## Reference

- [Persistent homology - An introduction via interactive examples](https://iuricichf.github.io/ICT/index.html) provides quick access to the theory of persistent homology.
